## Terraria Failure Counting
Records counts of death from each source for each player, and reports a tally upon failing again.

Inspired by a certain player on our server that dies way too often.

## Usage
Build the solution and copy the assembly to your TShock ServerPlugins folder.
The default storage method is via a Json file in the ServerPlugins folder. If needed, `IDeathRepository` can be further implemented to provide any storage method.
